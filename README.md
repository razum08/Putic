What is Putic?
----------------

Putic is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Putic uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Putin Classic is the name of open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Putin Classic software, see http://putic.ddns.net/

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Putic
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/razum08/putic/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Putic. ***TODO***
